```
4. Configure the environment variables:
## Configure the Environment Variables

To properly configure the environment variables for the Authentication and Authorization System, follow these steps:

1. Locate the `.env.example` file in the root directory of the project.

2. Create a new file named `.env` in the same directory.

3. Open the `.env.example` file and copy its contents.

4. Paste the contents into the newly created `.env` file.

5. Replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details. Below are some important variables to set:

   - `DATABASE_URL`: Set the URL or connection string for your database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).
   - `SESSION_SECRET`: Provide a strong and unique secret for session management.
   - `EMAIL_SERVICE`: Set the email service provider to be used for sending emails (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid).
   - `EMAIL_USER`: Provide the email address for the sender's account.
   - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Set the password for the sender's email account.
   - `JWT_SECRET`: (Optional) If you choose to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, set a secret for signing the tokens.

6. Save the `.env` file with the updated configuration.

## Usage

After configuring the environment variables, you can start using the Authentication and Authorization System API by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```
## The server will start running at http://localhost:3000

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints using HTTP client tools like [cURL](https://curl.se/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Below are some of the API endpoints you can interact with:

- `POST /api/register`: Register a new user by providing an email and password.
- `POST /api/login`: Log in with an existing user account using email and password.
- `GET /api/logout`: Log out the currently logged-in user.
- `POST /api/password-reset`: Request a password reset link by providing the registered email address.
- `GET /api/password-reset/:token`: Verify the password reset token and allow the user to set a new password.
- `GET /api/dashboard`: Access the user dashboard (requires authentication).

For detailed information on each endpoint, including request and response examples, refer to the API documentation.
